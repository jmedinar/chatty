tasks:

  - name: Rebooting and shutting down the System
    description: |
      System shutdown and reboot are critical administrative tasks.
      It's important to understand the different commands and their options.

      - `systemctl`: The systemd command to manage system services, 
                     including rebooting and shutting down, this is the 
                     preferred method on systems using systemd.

      In systems not using systemd, you might encounter other commands like:

      - `shutdown`: You can schedule a shutdown, send a warning message to 
                    users, and choose between shutting down and rebooting.
      - `reboot`: A simple command to reboot the system immediately.
      - `halt`: A simple command to halt the system immediately.
      - `poweroff`: A simple command to power off the system immediately.
    action: |
      *** THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ARE EXAMPLES AND SHOULD NOT BE EXECUTED ***

      To reboot the system immediately, you can use:
      
          systemctl reboot
      
      To power off the system immediately, you can use:

          systemctl poweroff

      To specify a time for the reboot or shutdown:

          systemctl reboot --when="8:25"
          systemctl poweroff --time="12:00am"

  - name: Understanding system target levels
    description: |
      A target represents a specific system state in which we group services
      and units that should be started or stopped together.

      So for example, the `graphical.target` is a target that includes all the
      services and units needed to run a graphical user interface.
    action: |
      List all the available targets on your system.
      
          sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=target

        static: Not enabled by default but can be started manually
        enabled: Will be started automatically at boot time
        disabled: Not enabled and will not be started automatically
        alias: Not targets themselves, but rather aliases for another target.

      You can also check the current target by running:

          sudo systemctl get-default

      You can change the default target by running:

          sudo systemctl set-default <target>

      Or temporarily switch to a different target by running:

          sudo systemctl isolate <target>

  - name: Using the `ps` command to view running processes
    description: |
      The `ps` command is used to display information about running processes.
      It can show you the process ID (PID), the user running the process, 
      the CPU and memory usage, and more.

      Common options include:

      - `-e`: Show all processes.
      - `-f`: Show full format listing.
      - `-u <user>`: Show processes for a specific user.

    action: |
      1. Run a couple of sleep commands in the background:
          sleep 1000 &
          sleep 2000 &

      2. Use the `ps` command to view running processes:
          ps -ef

      3. Use the `ps` command to see your own processes:
          ps -fu $(whoami)

      4. Add the `-l` option to see more details:
          ps -lfu $(whoami)

      5. Use the `-o` option to customize the output format:
          ps -fo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem

  - name: Sending signals to processes
    description: |
      Signals are used to communicate with processes. 
      You can send signals to processes to control their behavior.

      Common signals include:

      -  (3) SIGQUIT: Request a process to quit and create a core dump.
      -  (9) SIGKILL: Forcefully terminate a process.
      - (15) SIGTERM: Request a process to terminate gracefully.
      - (18) SIGCONT: Resume a paused process.
      - (19) SIGSTOP: Pause a process.

      See all available signals by running:

          kill -l

    action: |
      1. Find the PID of your `sleep` running processes from the previous task:
      
          pgrep -a sleep

      2. Send a SIGTERM signal to the `sleep 1000` process:
      
          kill -15 <PID>

      3. Send a SIGKILL signal to the `sleep 2000` process:
      
          kill -9 <PID>
    verification: ! pgrep sleep 2>/dev/null
    exit_code: 0

  - name: Foreground and background processes
    description: |
      Processes can run in the foreground or background, in other words,
      attached to your visible terminal or to a terminal running in the background.

      Use the `&` symbol to run a command in the background
      Use the `jobs` command to list background jobs
      Use the `fg` command to bring a background process to the foreground.
      Use the `bg` command to resume a stopped job in the background.
      
    action: |
      1. Run a couple of commands in the background:      
          sleep 9999 &
          sleep 8888 &

      2. List all background jobs:      
          jobs

      3. Bring the second background job "id 2" to the foreground:
          fg %2

      4. Pause the foreground job by pressing `Ctrl+Z`.

      5. List all background jobs again (you should see the job stopped):
          jobs

      6. Resume the stopped job in the background:
          bg %1

      7. List all background jobs again (you should see the job running):
          jobs

      8. Terminate the background jobs, one by one:
          kill %1
      
    verification: ! pgrep sleep 2>/dev/null
    exit_code: 0

  - name: Managing services with `systemctl`
    description: |
      The `systemctl` command is used to manage system services and targets.
      It can start, stop, enable, disable, and check the status of services.

      Common options include:

    exit_code: 0

  - name: Explore other services with `systemctl`
    description: |
      The `systemctl` command can also be used to explore other services
      and their status. You can list all active services, check the status
      of a specific service, and more.

      Common options include:

  - name: Scheduling jobs with `at`
    description: |
      The `at` command is used to schedule ONE-TIME jobs to run at a specific time.
      It allows you to run commands or scripts at a later time without needing to
      keep a terminal open.

      Common options include:

      - `-l`: List scheduled jobs.
      - `-d`: Delete a scheduled job.
      - `-f`: Specify a file containing the command to run.

      For example, 0 2 * * * means "every day at 2:00 AM"
    action: |
      1. List the current user's cron jobs:
          crontab -l  
      2. Edit the current user's cron jobs:
          crontab -e
      3. Add a new cron job to run a script every day at 2:00 AM:
          0 2 * * * echo "Hello, Cron! $(date)" >> /tmp/cron_test.log
      4. Save and exit the editor.
      5. List the current user's cron jobs again to verify the new job was added:
          crontab -l
    verification: sudo test -f /var/spool/cron/$USER 2>/dev/null
    exit_code: 0 

  - name: Scheduling jobs with `systemd timers`
    description: |
      Timers are a great alternative to `cron` jobs, as they are managed by
      `systemd` and can be easily monitored. They are configured with two files:
      a `.service` file that defines a task, and a `.timer` file that defines the schedule.

      A regular user can create their own timers without `sudo` by placing the
      files in `~/.config/systemd/user/` and using the `--user` flag.
      
      Common options include:
        - `systemctl list-timers`: List all active timers.
        - `systemctl start <timer>`: Start a specific timer.
        - `systemctl stop <timer>`: Stop a specific timer.
    action: |
      1. List all active timers for the current user:
            systemctl list-timers --user
      
      2. Create a directory for your user-level `systemd` units:
            mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
      
      2. Create a service file "~/.config/systemd/user/test-timer.service" 
         that prints a message to a file with the following content:
         
            [Unit]
            Description=My test timer
            [Service]
            ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'echo "Hello, Timer! $(date)" >> /tmp/timer_test.log'
         
      3. Create a timer file "~/.config/systemd/user/test-timer.timer"
         that runs the service every minute:

            [Unit]
            Description=My test timer
            [Timer]
            OnCalendar=minutely
            [Install]
            WantedBy=timers.target

      4. Reload your user's systemd daemon to find the new files:
            systemctl --user daemon-reload
      
      5. Enable and start the timer:
            systemctl --user enable --now test-timer.timer

      6. Check the status of your timer:
            systemctl --user status test-timer.timer
      
      7. After a minute list your timers again to see the new timer:
            systemctl --user list-timers

      8. Check the output in `/tmp/timer_test.log`:
            cat /tmp/timer_test.log 

    verification: test -f /tmp/timer_test.log 2>/dev/null
    exit_code: 0
